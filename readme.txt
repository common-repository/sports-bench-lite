Create the perfect sports WordPress website with minimal effort! Sports Bench Lite makes it extremely easy to create a great sports WordPress website in just minutes.

== Description ==
Creating and keeping up with sports league stats on the internet can be a hassle. Fortunately, the Sports Bench plugin takes all of the hard work away from you. After a simple five-minute (or less) setup, you're ready to start entering teams, players, games and even division and then watch the plugin do all of the other stuff for you. Sports Bench takes care of accumulating the stats you enter as well as the standings and schedules. The plugin has the ability to display the standings, a scoreboard of all game for the current season and statistical leaderboards. Show off game stats next to a recap of a game. Easily create pages for teams and players. And shortcodes allow you to show game, player or team information in any post. You have enough to worry about with managing your sports league; let us take care of the hard part.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does Sports Bench support multiple sports on the same site? =
Sports Bench only supports one sport on a site at the same time. That’s just how the plugin is written. If you would like to show multiple sports, you could create a WordPress Multisite install, with a different sport on each subsite (similar to the demos).

= Is the Sports Bench plugin compatible with my theme? =
Ideally it should be compatible with your theme. But that is also dependent on how your theme is created. If the theme is built up-to-WordPress standards (which includes any themes in the WordPress theme directory), then you shouldn’t have any issues. But the theme isn’t built right, you might run into issues.

= I want to extend the plugin to match what I need. How do I do that? =
Sports Bench already does a lot of what you need for your website. But if you need to extend it even further, be sure to check out the Documentation for the classes, functions and filters you need to customize the plugin.

= What sports does Sports Bench support? =
Sports Bench currently supports baseball, basketball, football, hockey, rugby, soccer and volleyball. More sports might be added over time.

== Installation ==
1. In the WordPress Dashboard, go to “Plugins” -> “Add New” and search for “Sports Bench Lite” and click install and activate, OR download the zip file of the plugin and go to “Plugins” -> “Add New” and click \"Upload Plugin\" and upload the zip file.
2. Once the plugin has been activated, you can click on "Sports Bench" in the left hand menu in the dashboard to set up the settings. Please note that when you set the sport for your website, you should not change it as it will rewrite the game tables and wipe out that data.
