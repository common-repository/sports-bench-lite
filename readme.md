## About Sports Bench

Creating and keeping up with sports league stats on the internet can be a hassle. Fortunately, the Sports Bench plugin takes all of the hard work away from you. After a simple five-minute (or less) setup, you're ready to start entering teams, players, games and even division and then watch the plugin do all of the other stuff for you. Sports Bench takes care of accumulating the stats you enter as well as the standings and schedules. The plugin has the ability to display the standings, a scoreboard of all game for the current season and statistical leaderboards. Show off game stats next to a recap of a game. Easily create pages for teams and players. And shortcodes allow you to show game, player or team information in any post. And if you use the Sports Bench theme, all of this comes with minimal front-end coding work for you. You have enough to worry about with managing your sports league; let us take care of the hard part.

## Installation
So now you've purchased the plugin. How do you get it up to your WordPress site? Well, there are two options you have: upload via the WordPress dashboard or via FTP. Here's how to do both options.

## Via WordPress Admin
This is the easiest and suggested way to upload your copy of the plugin to your site.
1. In the WordPress Dashboard, go to “Plugins” -> “Add New” and search for “Sports Bench Lite” and click install and activate, OR download the zip file of the plugin and go to “Plugins” -> “Add New” and click \"Upload Plugin\" and upload the zip file.
2. Once the plugin has been activated, you can click on "Sports Bench" in the left hand menu in the dashboard to set up the settings. Please note that when you set the sport for your website, you should not change it as it will rewrite the game tables and wipe out that data.

## Via FTP Upload
1. Go to "Plugins" and "Add New". Then hit the "Upload Plugin".
2. Upload the zip file for the plugin.
3. Activate the plugin after it has been installed.
4. Once the plugin has been activated, you can click on "Sports Bench" in the left hand menu in the dashboard to set up the settings. Please note that when you set the sport for your website, you should not change it as it will rewrite the game tables and wipe out that data.
